# AI Interview Platform Backend

This Flask backend will power the AI-driven voice interview platform. Key features:

- Document upload and text extraction (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- AI question generation using Google Gemini
- Real-time voice interaction (Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech)
- Interview session storage and scoring

## Directory Structure
- `app.py`: Main Flask app
- `routes/`: API endpoints
- `services/`: Core logic (document processing, AI, voice)
- `static/` and `templates/`: For frontend (if using Flask templates)

## Next Steps
- Implement document upload and extraction
- Integrate Gemini for question generation
- Add voice interaction endpoints
- Build scoring and session storage
