      "answer": "basically that for the classification problem I will understand the problem statement so which type of problem statement is these so which type of algorithm classification algorithm should I use so according to that I will first understand analyse the problem statement first after that I will I will take of 5 to 6 algorithms depending on the data and I will do the trial part give the what is the accuracy what are the what are the different different aspects of the different different algorithm on these in data and I will understand which is giving the more accurate so I will take that reasons for that to address issue so I will understand the which type of issue will occur during my project so that's all from ",

    "detailed_feedback": "The candidate's responses indicate a limited understanding of AI/ML concepts and a lack of practical experience. The candidate struggles to articulate their experience in a clear and concise manner. Their response to the first question is vague, lacking specific details about the project's goals, techniques used, and results achieved. Instead of describing a project, the candidate mentions generic challenges like 'which library to use' and vaguely mentions 'agentic tools.' This lacks the detail expected even from a fresher. The response to the second question regarding overfitting is also weak. While the candidate acknowledges the importance of understanding the problem statement and trying different algorithms, they fail to demonstrate an understanding of overfitting itself. They don't mention crucial strategies such as regularization, cross-validation, or gathering more data to address the issue. Their communication is unclear and repetitive, making it difficult to assess their technical knowledge. The 'trial part' mentioned for selecting algorithms doesn't demonstrate a structured approach to model selection or evaluation. In summary, the candidate needs to improve their communication skills and deepen their understanding of fundamental AI/ML concepts.",
